Project to demonstrated code quality checks

1. Via [Github pull request templates](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository). Use this to create a checklist of items to review. This is to be used by the PR author and the reviewer to ensure that the commonly reviewed items are not missed, and that everyone reviews PRs in the same way.
2. Setup [HoundCI](https://houndci.com). Setup a Github branch status check to require Hound to pass before a PR can be merged.
